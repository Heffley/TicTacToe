This is my first Android App, a simple Tic Tac Toe game, 
part of an assignment.

There are three modes to this game:
1. Player vs Player
The user of this app can select player vs player mode to play 
against a friend on the same phone.

2. Player vs Random AI
The user will play against the AI, where it randomly selects 
its moves.

3. Player vs AI (Hard)
This mode, the user will play against a hard AI, which uses 
minimax to figure out the best possible move for the itself to 
make the next move.
